				<h2 id="attention" class="about-p">A little about me:</h2>
				
				<p class="about-p">My interest in web development began in late 2012 by, honestly, osmosis. Friends in the industry would answer questions I had about their work, one thing led to another, and what had begun as simply interest, developed into something I felt passionate about learning. I began to imagine a new world of opportunity, and an exciting career for myself; at that point looking back was never an option. When my partners and I sold Corkbar at the end of 2013, where I was a partner and acting GM, I dedicated myself to making the leap. I had just become engaged and was ready with a support system of mentors and profesionals. My objective is to obtain a stable, entry-level position as a front-end developer doing primarily advanced HTML and CSS, while furthering my skills and growing within a company. It is my firm desire to further advance my current skills while becoming an expert-level developer in JavaScript technologies (my primary focus being jQuery, Angular and Node.js). While I have learned a great deal, I will never be done sharpening my skills, and that truly is the most exciting prospect for my future as a developer.</p>
				<p class="about-p">"Take care of ITC, and ITC will take care of you." Quoted from your Miss Victoria B. That quote is why I am interested in discussng this position. It is a mantra from my very own heart and beliefs. Previously as a small business owner, I was in the trenches every day with my employees and always expressed that sentiment in practice. The food and beverage industry can be seldom rewarding to those who work so hard but together, we gave and we truly did receive. That is a culture I will make my priority and give my absolute best to be a contributing part of.</p>
