			<h2>A little about me:</h2>
			
			<p>I began my career in IT a few years ago while I was a partner/owner/ and acting General Manager of a downtown wine bar and restaurant. Technology had become a more influential part of nearly all aspects of my business and I reached out to those friends of mine who worked in development and IT to answer question and offer advice. Long story short, I arrived at a place where I had been dabbling in HTML and CSS. I was using Code School and resources like Treehouse and had a developing interest and at least a new hobby. I and my partners had the opportunity to sell our business and as I had then recently decided I wanted to get engaged (she said yes!) began to make steps towards a career change. I had the time and the support system of real world mentors (great full-stack, and back end developers and friends) to make my new "Hobby" a very real career. I continue to meet my mentors multiple times a week. I've also been employed by them. I have committed the last 16 months to studying, learning and working towards this goal.</p>
			<p>"Take care of ITC, and ITC will take care of you." Quoted from your Miss Victoria B. That quote is why I am interested in discussng this position. It is a mantra from my very own heart and beliefs. Previously as a small business owner, I was in the trenches every day with my employees and always expressed that sentiment in practice. The food and beverage industry can be seldom rewarding to those who work so hard but together, we gave and we truly did receive. That is a culture I will make my priority and give my absolute best to be a contributing part of.</p>
